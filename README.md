# NESEmulator [![CI](https://github.com/Lauchmelder23/NESEmulator/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lauchmelder23/NESEmulator/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A very basic, cross-platform implementation of a classic NES Emulator.

I try to mimic the actual machines behaviour as closely as possible, striving for cycle accuracy as well as maintaining a lot of the quirks the original NES had.
